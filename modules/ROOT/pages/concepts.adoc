Client credentials:: Used establish an authenticated connection to Cerbos Hub using a client ID and a secret. You can create a client credentials for a Deployment to be used to with a Policy Decision Point to load policies and send back Audit Logs or a Policy Store for programmatic access to the policies in the store. Client credentials are created in the Settings â†’ Client credentials section of Cerbos Hub.
Deployment:: A versioned, immutable set of policies from one or many Policy Stores that Cerbos Hub compiles, validates, and packages into a bundle for distribution to PDPs. A new Deployment is built automatically whenever any of its referenced Policy Stores change, ensuring every connected PDP receives the same tested bundle at the same version, with full traceability and audit trail.
Organization:: An Organization serves as the top-level entity in Cerbos Hub and provides centralized control over billing, access control, and Workspace management. Typically a business would have one Organization and a number of Workspaces underneath it.
Policy bundle:: An encrypted file containing optimised binary representations of policies corresponding to a git commit. On every commit to the policy repository, if the git reference of the commit matches a configured label, Cerbos Hub validates the policies in the new commit, runs tests if there are any and produces a policy bundle that is then pushed to all connected PDPs that are configured to watch that label.
Policy Decision Point (Service PDP):: The open source Cerbos server instances that you run in your own infrastructure are called service PDPs. Cerbos Hub is the management control plane for PDP instances that are running inside your environment. Rather than each PDP being responsible for detecting policy changes, parsing, compiling and loading them, they get pre-compiled policy bundles pushed to them from Cerbos Hub. This model ensures that all your data remains within your network perimeter and that authorization checks happen locally with low latency while reducing the overhead of policy updates and the time it takes for the whole fleet to get in sync. A PDP must be configured with the name of a label, workspace secret and client credentials in order to connect to Cerbos Hub.
Policy playground:: A browser-based policy editor to quickly prototype, test and collaborate on Cerbos policies. An organization can have multiple playground instances and all authorized users of the organization have access to those instances.
Policy Store:: A versioned, logical container for one or more policy files managed directly inside Cerbos Hub. A Policy Store can be populated from any Git provider, CI or CD pipeline, the Cerbos Hub API via SDKs, the  xref:cerbos:cli:cerbosctl.adoc[`cerbosctl`] CLI, or a direct UI upload, allowing teams to manage their own policy sets independently and combine multiple stores into a single Deployment to create layered policy models such as global, environment, or tenant-specific rules.
Workspace:: A Workspace is a standalone policy project that groups related policies, tests, and deployment targets. Use Workspaces to separate policies by team, product, environment or any other boundary and attach PDPs to one or more Workspace deployments to receive the appropriate policy bundles.

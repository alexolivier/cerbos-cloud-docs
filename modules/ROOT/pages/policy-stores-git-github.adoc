= Cerbos Hub GitHub Integration

The Cerbos Hub GitHub integration allows you to manage your policies in a GitHub repository. This integration supports both public and private repositories, enabling you to store your policies securely and manage them using Git workflows.

== Prerequisites
Before you can use the Cerbos Hub GitHub integration, you need to have the following:
* A GitHub account.
* A GitHub repository where you want to store your policies.
* Permission to add a GitHub App to your repository.

== Setting Up the GitHub Integration
To set up the GitHub integration, follow these steps:

1. Go to the [Cerbos Hub](https://hub.cerbos.dev) and log in with your Cerbos account.
2. Inside a workspace, create a new policy store by clicking on "Policy Stores" in the sidebar.
3. In the Import tab, select "GitHub" as the source for your policy store.
4. Follow the prompts to authorize the Cerbos Hub to access your GitHub account.
5. Select the repository you want to use for storing your policies.
6. Configure the branch or tag for the integration to track, and optionally a directory where your policies will be stored.

== Using the GitHub Integration
Once the GitHub integration is set up, you can monitor and manage your policies directly in the GitHub connection tab. The integration will automatically sync changes made to the policies in your GitHub repository.

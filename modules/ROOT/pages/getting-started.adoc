= Getting started

== Prerequisites

A GitHub repository that contains your Cerbos policies and, optionally, tests. It can be private. If you are starting from scratch use https://github.com/cerbos/example-cerbos-policy-repository as a template.

Cerbos version 0.45.0 or higher.

Outbound internet access from your Cerbos instances so that they can connect to Cerbos Hub to fetch bundle updates and, if enabled, upload audit logs.

== Create a Policy Store and connect your Git repository

. Sign in to Cerbos Hub at https://hub.cerbos.cloud and follow the on-boarding wizard to create an Organization and its first Workspace.
. Inside the Workspace select Policy Stores then New Store.
. Give the Store a clear name, for example orders-service, choose GitHub repository as the source and connect to your GitHub account.
. Pick the branch you want Hub to track, usually main, and save. Cerbos Hub immediately ingests the repository, compiles the policies, and shows the first successful build.

TIP: You can create additional Stores for other branches, teams or projects.

== Create a Deployment

Deployments package one or more Policy Stores into a single, versioned bundle.

. Open Deployments then click New Deployment.
. Select the Store you just created.
. Click Create. Hub starts the initial build. When it finishes note the Deployment ID shown on the detail page - something like `C0TLEV4XCTAZ`. You will use this ID when configuring the PDP.

== Generate client credentials

Navigate to Settings → Client credentials and click "Generate a client crendential", giving it a name and select "Read & Write" so that polices can be pulled down and Audit Logs pushed back.. Copy both the Client ID and Client secret. The secret is shown only once.

== Configure and run a Cerbos PDP

You can pass the Hub connection settings as environment variables or in a YAML configuration file. The example below uses environment variables for a quick start:

[source,shell]
docker run --rm --name cerbos
-p 3592:3592 -p 3593:3593
-e CERBOS_HUB_DEPLOYMENT_ID="C0TLEV4XCTAZ" \ # Deployment ID from Hub
-e CERBOS_HUB_CLIENT_ID="..." \ # From Deployment ▸ Client credentials
-e CERBOS_HUB_CLIENT_SECRET="..." \ # From Deployment ▸ Client credentials
ghcr.io/cerbos/cerbos:latest server
Optional variable:

[horizontal]
CERBOS_HUB_PDP_ID:: The friendly name that will appear on the Cerbos Hub monitoring page. If omitted a random identifier is generated.

=== YAML alternative

[source,yaml]
server:
  httpListenAddr: ":3592"
  grpcListenAddr: ":3593"

hub:
credentials:
  pdpID: "orders-pdp-01" # Optional
  clientID: "..."
  clientSecret: "..."

storage:
  driver: hub
  hub:
    remote:
    deploymentID: deploy_4c12ef # Deployment ID from Hub
    
Assuming you saved the file as .cerbos.yaml in the current directory, start Cerbos with:

[source,shell]
docker run --rm --name cerbos
  -v $(pwd):/conf
  -p 3592:3592 -p 3593:3593
ghcr.io/cerbos/cerbos:latest server --config=/conf/.cerbos.yaml

See xref:cerbos:configuration:index.adoc[] for advanced configuration options.

== Enable audit log collection (optional)

Add the Hub audit backend to stream decision logs to Cerbos Hub:

[source,yaml]
audit:
  backend: hub
  hub:
    storagePath: "/var/cerbos/audit-buffer" # Local buffer used when the network is unavailable


Refer to xref:audit-log-collection.adoc[] for details on filtering sensitive fields and other advanced options.

With a Policy Store connected, a Deployment created, and at least one PDP running, you are ready to iterate on your policies. Push a change to the repository, watch Cerbos Hub build a new Deployment version, and see the PDP update itself automatically within seconds.

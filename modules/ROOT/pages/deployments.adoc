= Deployments

Cerbos Hub Deployments are immutable, versioned bundles of policies that Cerbos Hub builds, validates, tests, and distributes to your connected xref:decision-points.adoc[Policy Decision Points (PDPs)]. A single Deployment can combine policies from one or more xref:policy-stores.adoc[Policy Stores], letting you layer global guard rails, environment-specific rules, and tenant-specific overrides in one cohesive unit. Any change in a linked Policy Store, whether it comes from Git, a CI pipeline, the API, the CLI, or a direct UI upload, automatically triggers a new build so every PDP is always running the latest validated policy bundle.

[unordered.stack]
Source agnostic inputs:: Populate a Policy Store from any Git provider, CI system, API, CLI, or direct upload, so your existing workflows remain intact.
Multi-store composition:: Reference multiple stores in a Deployment to separate ownership, for example security team versus product team, or to blend static Git-managed policies with dynamic API-driven rules.
End-to-end automation:: Build, compilation, testing, signing, and distribution are fully managed by Cerbos Hub, giving you a consistent CI or CD style pipeline for authorization without extra infrastructure.
Traceability and rollback:: Every Deployment is immutable and carries a unique version identifier, making it easy to audit which policies were active for any PDP decision and to roll back if needed.

== Build life cycle

Whenever Cerbos Hub detects a change in any Policy Store referenced by a Deployment, it launches a new build.

. **In progress**: The build appears in the Cerbos Hub UI with the status **In progress**.
. **Compilation failures**: If policy compilation fails, the error is surfaced next to the build version so you can diagnose it quickly.
. **Test execution**: After successful compilation, Cerbos Hub runs all policy tests found across the contributing stores. Failures are displayed in the build details view with full logs for debugging.
. **Bundle generation**: When compilation and tests pass, the bundle status changes to **Generated** and all PDPs that are assigned to this Deployment receive a push notification instructing them to download and activate the bundle immediately.
